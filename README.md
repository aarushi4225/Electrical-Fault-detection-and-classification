# Electrical-Fault-detection-and-classification-with-Machine-learning
Created a Simulink model for electrical line fault data generation. Utilized MATLAB for data processing, trained diverse ML models, utilized 5-fold cross-validation. Compared model accuracy/confusion matrices, then applied the most accurate model to predict faults on new simulated data.
